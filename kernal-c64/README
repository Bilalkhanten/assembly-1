The almost completely commented C64 ROM disassembly. V1.01 Lee Davison 2012

Changed by Ruud Baltissen 2014
- changed names of routines and variables, LAzB_xx and LAzB_xxxx,.
  into more logical ones
- length of lines < 81 (if possible)
- combined low and high bytes to one variable
- corrected some small errors

This is a bit correct assembly listing for the C64 BASIC and kernal ROMs
as two 8K ROMs. You should be able to assemble the C64 ROMs from this with
most 6502 assemblers, as no macros or 'special' features were used. This has
been tested using Michal Kowalski's 6502 Simulator assemble function.
See http://exifpro.com/utils.html for this program.

Many references were used to complete this disassembly including, but not
limited to, "Mapping the Vic 20", "Mapping the C64", "C64 Programmers
reference", "C64 user guide", "The complete Commodore inner space anthology",
"VIC Revealed" and various text files, pictures and other documents.
